### PHP polyfills

Libraries that can help to reduce the feature gap between the KPHP and PHP.

For example, some builtin PHP extensions that are written in C can be implemented in PHP.
That PHP library can be used as a KPHP polyfill so it can use that functionallity even without
a C library port.

### Developer tools

Various CLI programs, editor/IDE plugins, language servers and so on. Everything that can make the KPHP developer life easier.

#### [KPHPStorm](https://github.com/unserialize/kphpstorm) - PhpStorm plugin that makes IDE understand KPHP specifics

#### [ktest](github.com/quasilyte/ktest) - a tool to execute unit tests and benchmarks for KPHP
